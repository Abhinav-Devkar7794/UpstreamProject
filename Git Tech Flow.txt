Git Account Create 
Connect Git Local to Remote using SSH
Create project -> clone project git clone ssh path of repository -> edit file
see diffrence git diff  ->  git add ./*

git commit -m 'first'

git push origin master

now pull updated data from github remote to local 

git pull origin master ( fetch updated data + merge it)

or 

git fetch ( fetch updated data )

git merge origin/master ( merge into exisiing data )

Now Branch creation :

git branch next-123  - create branch

git checkout next-123 - switch branch

	or

git checkout -b next-555

 Stash :

1) when you want to switch branch.

git stash ( system message )

git stash list

git stash pop ( remove from list )

2) add updated data to your file and then put your current data above the data.

git stash save 'message' ( custome message )

git stash list

git stash apply stash id  (  stash did not delete )


3) suppose if you get ticket get back for changes then also you have to first reset last commit then put it in stash and 
then download updated code ( commits ) then put stash code back.



== Revert and Reset ===  Revert is not use for one commit back because it generate one more commit in commit history.

if you want change last commit then use it 

git reset HEAD~1

if file is edit but not commited then you want to get back privious state of file then use 

git checkout . or filename


if file is updated but not added .

then you can take changes back .

git checkout Test

you can delete file 

rm Test
git checkout Test
